- Updated `Dockerfile.optimized` with multi-architecture support
- Added build arguments for platform detection
- Implemented conditional package installation for different architectures

**Supported Architectures**:
- **linux/amd64**: Primary x86_64 architecture
- **linux/arm64**: ARM64 for Apple Silicon and ARM servers  
- **linux/arm/v7**: ARM v7 for Raspberry Pi and similar devices

**Multi-Architecture Features**:
