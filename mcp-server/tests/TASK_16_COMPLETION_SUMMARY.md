### 3. End-to-End Tests ⚠️
**File:** `tests/integration/test_end_to_end.py`
**Status:** Implemented but experiencing pytest collection issues

**Implemented Test Categories:**
- **Successful Workflows:** Complete pipeline testing
- **Failure Scenarios:** Error handling at each step
- **Performance Tests:** Concurrent execution, load testing

**Test Scenarios Covered:**
- Simple diagram workflow (prompt → XML → save → PNG)
- AWS architecture diagram workflow
- LLM service failure handling
- File service failure handling
