# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the core functionality of an existing AI Diagram Generator web application into a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. The MCP server will be packaged as a lightweight container that can be used with Claude Code, providing diagram generation capabilities through standardized MCP tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Claude Code user, I want to generate Draw.io XML diagrams from natural language prompts, so that I can quickly create visual representations of my ideas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a natural language prompt THEN the system SHALL generate valid Draw.io XML content
2. WHEN the XML is generated THEN the system SHALL validate the XML structure for required elements (mxfile, mxGraphModel, root)
3. IF the generated XML is invalid THEN the system SHALL return an error with specific validation details
4. WHEN generating AWS diagrams THEN the system SHALL apply AWS-specific diagram rules and conventions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Claude Code user, I want to save generated Draw.io XML content to files, so that I can persist and reuse my diagrams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to save XML content THEN the system SHALL create a .drawio file with a unique identifier
2. WHEN a file is saved THEN the system SHALL return a file ID for future reference
3. WHEN a file is saved THEN the system SHALL store metadata including creation time and filename
4. IF file saving fails THEN the system SHALL return an error with specific failure details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Claude Code user, I want to convert Draw.io files to PNG images, so that I can use the diagrams in presentations and documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests PNG conversion THEN the system SHALL convert the .drawio file to PNG format
2. WHEN Draw.io CLI is available THEN the system SHALL use it for high-quality conversion
3. IF Draw.io CLI is not available THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message with fallback options
4. WHEN conversion succeeds THEN the system SHALL return the PNG file path or Base64 encoded content
5. WHEN conversion fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MCP server to run in a lightweight Docker container, so that it can be easily deployed and managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the container is built THEN it SHALL be less than 500MB in size
2. WHEN the container starts THEN it SHALL initialize all required services within 30 seconds
3. WHEN the container runs THEN it SHALL operate continuously for 24+ hours without crashes
4. WHEN the container is deployed THEN it SHALL include health checks for service availability
5. IF Draw.io CLI is required THEN the container SHALL include it in the build

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL categorize errors by type (authentication, rate limit, service unavailable)
3. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific file system error details
4. WHEN the system encounters unexpected errors THEN it SHALL gracefully handle them without crashing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Claude Code user, I want fast response times through caching, so that repeated requests are handled efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identical prompts are submitted THEN the system SHALL return cached results if available
2. WHEN cache entries expire THEN the system SHALL automatically remove them
3. WHEN cache size limits are reached THEN the system SHALL remove oldest entries first
4. WHEN cache is used THEN response time SHALL be under 1 second for cached content

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automatic cleanup of temporary files, so that storage doesn't accumulate indefinitely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN temporary files are created THEN they SHALL have expiration timestamps
2. WHEN files expire THEN the system SHALL automatically delete them
3. WHEN cleanup runs THEN it SHALL log the number of files removed
4. WHEN storage is low THEN the system SHALL prioritize cleanup of oldest files

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that the system is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL have corresponding unit tests
2. WHEN integration points exist THEN they SHALL have integration tests
3. WHEN the full workflow is tested THEN end-to-end tests SHALL cover prompt → XML → PNG conversion
4. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage
